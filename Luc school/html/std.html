				Sensitive data exposure<br><br>

				Sensitive data exposure is an common cyberthreat that endangers businesses and their clients, as well as websites and their visitors. More frequently known as a data breach, sensitive data exposure ranks as one of the Top 10 most dangerous cyberthreats by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) because of the damage it can do to its victims.<br><br>
				<h2>What is OWASP top 10</h2><br><br>
				The OWASP Top 10 is a list of ten most dangerous web applications. Sensitive data exposure currently ranks sixth on this list.  The purpose of this list is to make people aware of the danger of web applications. <br><br>
				<h2>what are the consequences of Sensitive data exposure</h2><br><br>
				Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application, like a smartphone app or a browser, does not protect information such as passwords, payment info, or health data. With this information, cybercriminals can make fraudulent purchases, access a victim&#146;s personal accounts, or even personal blackmail. In 2016, 4.8 billion records containing personal data were compromised as a result of data breaches.
				Sensitive data exposure can be financially devastating to website. One data breach costs an average of 3.8 million due to direct costs, such as the cost of investigating the breach, and indirect costs, like reputation damage. While big-name businesses can usually weather a data breach, smaller websites and businesses often canâ€™t afford the fallout.<br><br>

<h2>Sensitive data exposure example</h2><br><br>

Example 1: Credit card encryption
An application encrypts credit card numbers in a database using automatic database encryption. However, this means it also decrypts this data automatically when retrieved, allowing a SQL injection flaw to retrieve credit card numbers in clear text.<br><br>
Example 2: password
The password database uses unsalted hashes to store everyone&#146;s passwords risk
A file upload flaw allows an attacker to retrieve the password file. All of the unsalted hashes can be exposed with a rainbow table of precalculated hashes<br><br>
