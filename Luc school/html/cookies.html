				Cookies seem harmless, a lot of people press ‘ok’ without
even knowing what it is. Well we are going to explain this to
you.<br><br>
A cookie is a type of message that is given to a Web browser by a Web server. The purpose
of a cookie is identifying users, customize Web pages and to save login information.<br><br>
When you use cookies while entering a Web site, you may be asked to fill a form where you
have to give them your personal information: like your name and e-mail. They put this

information into a cookie and sent it to your Web browser, this Web browser stores the
information for later use. When you enter the same Web site, your Web browser will send the
cookie (that contains your information) to the Web server.<br><br>
Some websites may not be secure, allowing hackers to intercept cookies an view the
information they carry. The cookies themselves are not harmful, but because they may carry
sensitive information, you should only use cookies on sites you trust to be safe and secure.<br><br>

I personally find cookies irritating. Have you ever clicked on an ad and later noticed more and
more advertisements for the same product? Advertising networks can set and use cookies to
track the ads you’ve viewed, and then show you similar advertisements to try and increase
the relevance of their ads to you. Cookies can also slow down your computer. New cookies
are constantly being created as you visit websites. Taking up disk space, which may
eventually result in slower computer speeds.<br><br>
There are cookies people often don’t speak about. There is a cookie that’s growing right now,
more and more people are starting to use it. This cookie is called the malicious cookie, these
types of cookies are used to track your activity online. They track you and your surfing habits
to build a profile of your interest. When that profile has enough information about you it can
be sold to an advertising company who uses this information to target you with specific
adverts.<br><br>
