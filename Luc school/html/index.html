Welcome to our website,<br><br>
Our website is about data and the misuse of it, data is  information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing. Relative to today&#180s computers and transmission media, data is information converted into binary digital form. It is acceptable for data to be used as a singular subject. Raw data is a term used to describe data in its most basic digital format.<br><br>
The concept of data in the context of computing has its roots in the work of Claude Shannon, an American mathematician known as the father of information theory<br><br>
Computers represent data, including video, images, sounds and text, as binary values using patterns of just two numbers: 1 and 0. A bit is the smallest unit of data, and represents just a single value. A byte is eight binary digits long. Storage and memory is measured in megabytes and gigabytes.<br><br>
Most organizations gather and store a large amount of sensitive data. Client databases with personal and financial information, internal documentation detailing trade secrets, content and technologies produced by an organization, etc. Employees, sub-contractors, and third-party vendors often access this data on a daily basis. This opens the very real possibility for data to be misused, either intentionally for personal gain, or inadvertently.<br><br>
Data misuse is the inappropriate use of data as defined when the data was initially collected. Misuse of information typically can be governed by laws and corporate cybersecurity policy. However, even with laws and policies in place, the potential for data misuse is growing. <br><br>
We hope our website will give you a visual about the danger of data misuse. You will find out about a few subjects, like, sensitive data exposure, cookies, and Data itself.  You can use this information to make smarter choices when &quotsurfing on the web&quot.
