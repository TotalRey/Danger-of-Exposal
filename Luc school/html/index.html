				We are two students who are highly worried about the privacy of the people. Our names are. Eylem Karatas and Luc Offermans, we are students at the HAN university of applied. sciences and we follow the communication course. 97% of people are somewhat worried. about the fact that companies collect personal data. We are aware of the fact that something is being collected, but often do not know what data this is. This causes uncertainty. What happens to our digital data? That’s the questions we are going to answer. To answer the question, why did we choose this topic, the answer is easy, data has become a very about us..<br><br> 

				What is data?<br><br>
