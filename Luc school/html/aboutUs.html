				We are two students who are highly worried about the privacy of the people. Our names are. Eylem Karatas and Luc Offermans, we are students at the HAN university of applied. sciences and we follow the communication course. 97% of people are somewhat worried. about the fact that companies collect personal data. We are aware of the fact that something is being collected, but often do not know what data this is. This causes uncertainty. What happens to our digital data? That&#146;s the questions we are going to answer. To answer the question, why did we choose this topic, the answer is easy, data has become a very about us..<br><br> 

				What is data?<br><br>

				Cookies
				Sensitive data
				exposure<br><br>

				important topic in our current society. Because everything is being digitized, we think that it isimportant to create a certain awareness for the people.<br><br>


To what extent can the government retain data from you as a person and to what extent is your privacy guaranteed in this? Are we as human beings sufficiently aware of all the data that is stored when we surf the web for a moment? Are we as human beings sufficiently informed about data and do we, ethically speaking, agree with the rules that are enforced? Every person can have their own opinion about this and we want to create an image with this site that hopefully creates a certain consciousness among people. We live in a time when data consumption is almost inevitable and we also live in a time where digitization is a concept that often comes back worldwide. Apart from the fact that many of us are not aware of the concept of data, data is certainly aware of ours. Based on a bit of footage, data does already know a lot about us ...

				uncertainty is one of the worst feelings one can have, that&#146;s why we made this website.<br><br>
