				So what Does it look like? A collection of zeros and ones, stored on a data carrier? That is a very broad description and does not say much. Moreover, the follow-up question; what are these zeros and ones then? A lawyer must be able to put things in a box in order to say something about it. Roughly speaking, there are two legal tastes: 'business' and 'property rights'. A case is a material object that is susceptible to human control.<br><br>

So data is not a matter because nobody can grasp information. A property right is only called (in short) when it concerns a right that, individually or together with another right, is intended to provide a party with a material advantage. Think of a right to payment, a right to delivery of a case or service etc. Also this description does not apply to data. What now? There are certain types of data that do fall under a legal regime. Personal data are covered by the Personal Data Protection Act, source code falls under the Copyright Act (if creatively enough) and a database is subject to database right under certain conditions.<br><br>

But what to do with data or information that does not fall under the above categories? From that data it is not immediately clear who it is and what may happen to it. Who are your stored e-mails in the cloud? What to do with the customer data included in your accountant's billing program? This type of data does not necessarily fall under a special legal regime. In other words; this kind of data is nothing (legally speaking). If the law is not clear, it is up to the parties themselves to make clear agreements. Do this too! Because data can legally be nothing, for you or your company data can be of vital importance and also worth a lot. Especially in cloud services where data from one party is stored on the servers of the other party, clear agreements are very important.<br><br>
